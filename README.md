# udu - update-distro-upgrade
Simple bash script to update and upgrade any distro with apt without confirms. Designed with Ubuntu in mind.
---
It runs update, upgrade and dist-upgrade, then autoremove.
Bear in mind that it will NOT ask for any confirmations, so it's more a lazyness-solution for non-production servers.

Usage: download and run with
```
sh script.sh
```
